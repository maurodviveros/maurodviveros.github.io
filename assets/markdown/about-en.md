  <p>My name is <b>Mauro Daniel Viveros</b>, I am a Semi-Senior Developer in Frontend and Backend development (Fullstack) for WEB and MOBILE Applications. I am also dabbling my career entering the area of DEV-OPS.</p>
  <p>My first immersion into the IT world (2016), was reading a C programming book, watching Youtube tutorial videos and forums. Even though I got into programming, I still didn't have the knowledge necessary to do something <b>"productive"</b>.</p>
